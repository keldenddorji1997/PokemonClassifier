# PokemonClassifier
Predicts the type of Pokemon from its stats <br/>
This is a submission for Siraj's Pokemon Classifier Contest : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xVqLJe9_CY <br/>
The dataset is taken from Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon

# Dependencies

Theano (pip install theano) <br/>
NumPy (pip install numpy) <br/>
Pandas (pip install pandas) <br/>

# Demo

Run in terminal: <br/>
$ python PokemonClassifier.py

# Results

The neural network built on Theano is trained to an accuracy of 32.917% in about 3 minutes on CPU. After training, the user can input the stats of a pokemon, and the model will predict its type. <br/>

I thank Siraj Raval for the contest and video explanations, and Alberto Barradas for the Pokemon dataset.
